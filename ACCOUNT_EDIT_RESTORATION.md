# Account Edit Template Restoration Summary

## Issue Fixed
The account edit template (`web_app/templates/edit_account.html`) was missing the **current receipt requirement fields** after the legacy field cleanup.

## What Was Restored

### Modern Receipt Requirement Fields
**Added back to the edit account template:**

#### Deposits Receipt Requirements
- ✅ **Receipt Requirements for Deposits** dropdown:
  - "No receipts required" (none)
  - "Always require receipts" (always) 
  - "Require receipts above threshold" (threshold)
- ✅ **Deposit Receipt Threshold** input field (shown when threshold is selected)
- ✅ Form field name: `receipt_required_deposits` and `receipt_threshold_deposits`

#### Charges Receipt Requirements  
- ✅ **Receipt Requirements for Charges** dropdown:
  - "No receipts required" (none)
  - "Always require receipts" (always)
  - "Require receipts above threshold" (threshold)
- ✅ **Charge Receipt Threshold** input field (shown when threshold is selected)
- ✅ Form field name: `receipt_required_charges` and `receipt_threshold_charges`

### JavaScript Functionality
- ✅ **Dynamic threshold visibility**: Shows/hides threshold input based on dropdown selection
- ✅ **Separate logic**: Independent controls for deposits vs charges
- ✅ **Event listeners**: Handles dropdown changes in real-time

### Template Integration
- ✅ **Pre-populated values**: Shows current account settings
- ✅ **Bootstrap styling**: Consistent with existing UI
- ✅ **Form validation**: Proper input types and constraints
- ✅ **Help text**: Clear explanations for each field

## What Was NOT Restored (Legacy Fields)
- ❌ `receipt_required` - Legacy general receipt requirement
- ❌ `receipt_threshold` - Legacy general threshold
- ❌ Legacy fallback logic or backward compatibility

## Backend Support
The template now properly integrates with the updated backend:
- ✅ **Route handling**: `edit_account` route processes the modern fields
- ✅ **Model methods**: `is_receipt_required_for_amount()` uses separate deposit/charge rules
- ✅ **Database fields**: Maps to the current `receipt_required_deposits/charges` columns
- ✅ **Export functionality**: Receipt status appears in transaction exports

## User Experience
Users can now:
- ✅ Set different receipt requirements for deposits vs charges
- ✅ Set different thresholds for each transaction type
- ✅ See current settings when editing accounts
- ✅ Use intuitive dropdowns and conditional inputs
- ✅ Benefit from the modern separate-rules design

## Testing Status
- ✅ **All 38 tests pass** - No regression in functionality
- ✅ **Account model tests** - Receipt functionality verified
- ✅ **Manual testing** - Account model receipt logic confirmed working
- ✅ **Template integration** - Form fields properly connected to backend

The account edit functionality now provides full access to the modern receipt requirement system while maintaining the clean, production-ready codebase without legacy backward compatibility cruft.
