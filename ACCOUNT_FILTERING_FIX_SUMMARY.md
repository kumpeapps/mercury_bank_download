# Account Filtering Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The account filter checkboxes on the transactions page were not working correctly:
1. Filtering to a specific account (e.g., "Mercury Savings ••1996") would show transactions from a different account (e.g., "Mercury Checking ••3295")
2. Removing the filter would keep the page filtered to one account with only one transaction shown
3. Selected checkboxes were not preserved after filtering

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a critical backend bug in `/web_app/app.py` at line 335-340:

```python
# ORIGINAL BUGGY CODE
if account_ids:
    # Convert account_ids to integers for the query
    account_ids = [int(aid) for aid in account_ids if aid.isdigit()]
    if account_ids:
        query = query.filter(Transaction.mercury_account_id.in_(account_ids))
```

**Problem**: The code was attempting to convert UUID strings to integers, but Mercury account IDs are UUID strings (e.g., `867a1270-54fe-11f0-9652-b7f2a577d83a`). The `isdigit()` check would always fail for UUIDs, causing the filter to be ignored or applied incorrectly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix
Fixed the account ID handling in `/web_app/app.py`:

```python
# FIXED CODE
if account_ids:
    # Account IDs are UUIDs (strings), no conversion needed
    query = query.filter(Transaction.mercury_account_id.in_(account_ids))
```

### 2. Frontend Fix  
Removed interfering JavaScript from `/web_app/templates/transactions.html` that was preventing proper form submission:

```javascript
// REMOVED PROBLEMATIC CODE
document.getElementById('filter-form').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault(); // This was preventing form submission
    // Manual URL building logic that was causing issues
});
```

The form now uses standard GET method submission, matching the working approach used in the reports page.

## Technical Details

### Backend Changes
- **File**: `/web_app/app.py`
- **Lines**: 335-340
- **Change**: Removed integer conversion logic for account IDs
- **Reason**: Mercury account IDs are UUID strings, not integers

### Frontend Changes
- **File**: `/web_app/templates/transactions.html`
- **Change**: Removed JavaScript that prevented default form submission
- **Reason**: Standard GET form submission works correctly and matches reports page behavior

### Filter Form Structure
The filter form now correctly submits as GET request with parameters:
- `account_id` - Multiple values supported for multi-account filtering
- `status` - Multiple values supported for status filtering
- Method: `GET` (standard form submission)

## Verification Results

Comprehensive testing shows all filtering scenarios now work correctly:

### ✅ Tests Passed (9/9)
1. **User login**: Successfully authenticates test user
2. **Page loading**: Transactions page loads without errors
3. **Account detection**: Correctly identifies all available accounts
4. **Single account filtering**: Filters to specific account correctly
5. **Checkbox preservation**: Selected checkboxes remain checked after filtering
6. **Filter clearing**: Removing filters shows all transactions
7. **Multiple account filtering**: Multiple account selection works
8. **Status filtering**: Transaction status filters work correctly
9. **Combined filtering**: Account + status filters work together

### Test Coverage
- **Single account filtering**: ✅ Shows correct transactions for selected account
- **Multiple account filtering**: ✅ Multiple accounts can be selected simultaneously
- **Status filtering**: ✅ Filter by pending, sent, etc.
- **Combined filtering**: ✅ Account and status filters work together
- **Checkbox preservation**: ✅ Selected filters remain selected after submission
- **Filter clearing**: ✅ Removing all filters shows all transactions
- **URL handling**: ✅ Direct URLs with filters work correctly

## Files Modified
1. `/web_app/app.py` - Fixed backend account ID handling
2. `/web_app/templates/transactions.html` - Removed interfering JavaScript

## Deployment
- Used `./dev.sh rebuild-dev` to rebuild and restart development environment
- Changes tested in Docker containers matching production environment
- No database migrations required (schema unchanged)

## Impact
- ✅ Account filtering now works as expected
- ✅ Checkbox states are preserved after filtering
- ✅ Multiple account selection supported
- ✅ Combined account + status filtering works
- ✅ Filter clearing works correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Matches behavior of working reports page

## Testing Commands Used
```bash
# Rebuild development environment
./dev.sh rebuild-dev

# Run comprehensive tests
python final_comprehensive_test.py

# Manual testing
python debug_manual_filtering.py
python verify_filtering_fix.py
python test_advanced_filtering.py
```

The account filtering functionality is now fully operational and matches the user's requirements.
